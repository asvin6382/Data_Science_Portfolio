## EDA :
  *  ### [ Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis ](./Exploratory_data_analysis/):
   - This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix data. In this analysis, I have performed various data
   visualization and storytelling based on the dataset. The process includes data preprocessing to handle null values and missing data.
   Additionally, I have used TextBlob for sentiment analysis of descriptions. Finally, the repository includes a conclusion summarizing the insights gained from the 
   analysis.

## Statistical Analysis
   ### [Forest Fire Dataset Analysis](./Preprocessing/)
   - This mini project reflects the beginnings of my data science journey during my academic pursuits. It is a basic exploration of the Forest Fire dataset, focusing on fundamental statistical analysis and a simple linear regression prediction. As I continue to learn and grow, I look forward to more complex and exciting data science projects ahead. Your feedback and guidance are greatly appreciated as I progress in this field.
## NLP
   ### [Web Scraping and Data Analysis - Blog Content Analysis](./NLP/)
   -  Natural Language Processing (NLP)! In this project, I've combined web scraping using Beautiful Soup and requests with extensive data analysis to extract valuable variables from a company's web blog content. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify and analyze various attributes like positive and negative sentiment scores, word counts, and more for the content of a specific company's blog
   -  This project showcases the power of NLP and web scraping in extracting valuable information from unstructured text data. By identifying and analyzing variables such as sentiment scores and word counts, we gain valuable insights into the company's blog content. The ability to export these insights to an Excel file makes them easily accessible for further analysis or reporting.
   -  s I continue my journey in the field of NLP and data analysis, I look forward to more complex projects and applications. Your feedback and guidance are highly appreciated as I continue to explore the exciting world of natural language processing and data science.
## Machine Learning
   ### Supervised Learning
   ### [Customer Purchase Quantity Prediction](./Machine%20Learning/)
   - Welcome to my journey in the world of machine learning! In this project, I explore the task of predicting customer purchase quantities, focusing on supervised learning techniques. This project marks my early steps into the field of machine learning during my academic journey
   - This project represents my early steps into the world of machine learning, with a focus on predicting customer purchase quantities using supervised learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and deployment. As I continue to learn and grow in the field of machine learning, I look forward to more advanced projects and applications
## Power Bi
   ### [Call Center Performance Dashboard](./Power%20Bi/)
   In this visualization project, we provide a comprehensive overview of our call center's performance, showcasing both individual employee metrics and an overall 
   report for the entire team. This dashboard is designed to help us gain valuable insights into our operations, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate our 
   successes.
