## EDA :
  *  ### [ Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis ](./Exploratory_data_analysis/):
   - This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix data. In this analysis, I have performed various data
   visualization and storytelling based on the dataset. The process includes data preprocessing to handle null values and missing data.
   Additionally, I have used TextBlob for sentiment analysis of descriptions. Finally, the repository includes a conclusion summarizing the insights gained from the 
   analysis.

## Statistical Analysis
   ### [Forest Fire Dataset Analysis](./Preprocessing/)
   - This mini project reflects the beginnings of my data science journey during my academic pursuits. It is a basic exploration of the Forest Fire dataset, focusing on fundamental statistical analysis and a simple linear regression prediction. As I continue to learn and grow, I look forward to more complex and exciting data science projects ahead. Your feedback and guidance are greatly appreciated as I progress in this field.

   ### [Customer Purchase Quantity Prediction](./Machine%20Learning/)
   - Welcome to my journey in the world of machine learning! In this project, I explore the task of predicting customer purchase quantities, focusing on supervised learning techniques. This project marks my early steps into the field of machine learning during my academic journey
   - This project represents my early steps into the world of machine learning, with a focus on predicting customer purchase quantities using supervised learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and deployment. As I continue to learn and grow in the field of machine learning, I look forward to more advanced projects and applications
## Power Bi
   ### [Call Center Performance Dashboard](./Power%20Bi/)
   In this visualization project, we provide a comprehensive overview of our call center's performance, showcasing both individual employee metrics and an overall 
   report for the entire team. This dashboard is designed to help us gain valuable insights into our operations, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate our 
   successes.
