  ### [Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis](Data_Science_Portfolio/Exploratory_data_analysis/)

   This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix data. In this analysis, I have performed various data visualization and storytelling based 
  on the dataset. The process includes data preprocessing to handle null values and missing data. Additionally, I have used TextBlob for sentiment analysis of 
  descriptions. Finally, the repository includes a conclusion summarizing the insights gained from the analysis.
