  *  ### [ Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis ](./Exploratory_data_analysis/):
   - This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Netflix data. In this analysis, I have performed various data
   visualization and storytelling based on the dataset. The process includes data preprocessing to handle null values and missing data.
   Additionally, I have used TextBlob for sentiment analysis of descriptions. Finally, the repository includes a conclusion summarizing the insights gained from the 
   analysis.

## Statistical Analysis
   ### [Forest Fire Dataset Analysis](./Preprocessing/)
   - This mini project reflects the beginnings of my data science journey during my academic pursuits. It is a basic exploration of the Forest Fire dataset, focusing on fundamental statistical analysis and a simple linear regression prediction. As I continue to learn and grow, I look forward to more complex and exciting data science projects ahead. Your feedback and guidance are greatly appreciated as I progress in this field.
